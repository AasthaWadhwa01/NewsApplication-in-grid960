                    <p>Iran on Thursday reiterated its assertion that new U.S. sanctions against the Muslim country constitute a “breach” of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers.

                        <br> He warned that Iran will come up with a “smart” reaction to the sanctions approved by President Donald Trump and avoid getting “entangled in U.S. policies.”
